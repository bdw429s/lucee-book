# Lucee Admin

Every Lucee installation comes with an Administrator that allows you to configure settings about the Lucee process and your websites. There are at least two Administrators, one for the [Server Context](/lucee/content/lucee_context.html), and one for each domain name on your server ([Web Context](/lucee/content/lucee_context.html)). 

To access the Administrator of your running website, go to yourdomain.com/lucee/admin/web.cfm for the Web Context's Admin, and yourdomain.comlucee/admin/server.cfm for the Server Context's Admin

You should see something like this:
