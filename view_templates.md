# View Templates
Creating HTML views and fragments in Lucee is typically implementing using [Templates](https://rorylaitila.gitbooks.io/lucee/content/templates.html). Though techically, any script (template or Component) can output to the output buffer, convention for clarity is that HTML goes into templates only.
