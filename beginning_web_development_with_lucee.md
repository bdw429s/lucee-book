# Beginning Web Development with Lucee



## A Web Application Server

Lucee is considered an Application Server. An Application Server is a self contained fully inclusive software with which to build web applications. Lucee contains all of the components necessary to run a full website on any server. In comparison, most similar scripting languages (PHP, Python, Ruby) are not Application Servers (although some vendors provide application servers for those languages). Application Servers typically provide more out of the box pieces than the typical programming language. An Application Server is akin to starting a McDonalds, most if not everything that you need is provided, vs starting a restaurant from scratch.


## A programming language for the web


Lucee allows you to program web sites easily. As a Web Programming language, it contains everything you need to write HTML pages, create forms, send emails, access databases, create automatic tasks, and more. It is like any other programming language with data, ifs, loops and outputs. However, Lucee uses a language called "CFML" which was designed for easy integration into HTML. CFML stands for ColdFusion Markup Language and is a tag based language just like HTML. This makes getting started in CFML relatively easy. Here is an example of CFML:
