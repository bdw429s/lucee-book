# Introduction

Lucee is a feature complete web application development tool that can be used to create very simple to complex web applications. Anything from e commerce shopping websites, to business applications, to social networks.

This Developing Applications section assumes that you have a basic understanding of Web Application development, perhaps in other languages and frameworks like PHP or RubyOnRails. It also assumes that you are developing custom applications, typically from the ground up. As opposed to merely configuring a Content Management System (CMS) or Ecommerce type system off the shelf. 

This should be read as a reference and guide for the major features of Lucee and common concerns when building applications wtih Lucee.
