# Lists
Lucee has lists which are strings with a delimiter (default is a comma). Lists can only contain strings (and they are a string themselves), so use an Array to contain complex data types. Lists are not real objects in Lucee, and are simply strings that contain a delimiter. Any string can be a list (even a string with a delimiter of a zero length string "")

##Create a List
To create a list, create a string with a delimiter. The default delimiter for list functions is a comma, but any dilimiter is possible.
