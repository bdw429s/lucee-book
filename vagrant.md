# Vagrant

For simple development tasks, CommandBox provides an [embedded development server](https://rorylaitila.gitbooks.io/lucee/content/lucee_server.html) which is easy to get started, however it is not suitable for running production servers. If you want to develop locally with a full VM that mirrors your production environment, [Vagrant](https://www.vagrantup.com) is a useful tool for this.
