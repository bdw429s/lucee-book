# View Templates
Creating HTML views and fragments in Lucee is typically implementing using [Templates](https://rorylaitila.gitbooks.io/lucee/content/templates.html). Though techically, any script (template or Component) can output to the output buffer, convention for clarity is that HTML goes into templates only.

This article assumes that you are not using a Framework. If you are using a framework, follow the templating conventions of that framework.
